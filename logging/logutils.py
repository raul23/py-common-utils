    """Get a console or console+file logger.

    This function can build a logger from scratch, i.e. without any logging
    config ``dict``. In that case, a console logger is returned.

    Also, it can setup a console and file logger if a logging config ``dict``
    is passed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    module_name : str
        Name of the module, e.g. ``'__main__'``
    module_file : str
        Module's filename, e.g. run_scraper.py
    cwd : str
        Module's current working directory, e.g. .../lyrics-scraper/script
    logger : dict or LoggingWrapper, optional
        The logger can be setup through a logging configuration ``dict``. If a
        logger of type ``LoggingWrapper`` is passed, it implies that a logger
        is already setup and thus the same logger is returned. (the default
        value is ``None`` which implies that a console logger will be setup
        from scratch, i.e. without a logging configuration ``dict``).

    Returns
    -------
    logger : LoggingWrapper
        A logger that can log to console and file at the same time.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        Raised if `logger` is not of type ``LoggingWrapper``.

    Notes
    -----
    The reason that we process the case when `logger` is already a logger of
    type ``LoggingWrapper`` is that the main script's logger could be shared
    throughout all custom modules, and therefore every call to this function
    will return the same shared logger.

    ``LoggingWrapper`` defines a logger that can log to console and file at the
    "same time".

def get_logger_name(module_name, module_file, cwd):
    """Get the logger's name for a module.

    The logger's name is built based on:
    1.  the module's current working directory and its filename or
    2.  the module's name.

    Also, the logger's name ends with '.c' (for a console logger) or '.f' (for
    a file logger), e.g. `script.run_scraper.c` and `script.run_scraper.f`.

    The returned logger's name can then be used to setup a logger.

    Parameters
    ----------
    module_name : str
        Name of the module, e.g. ``'__main__'``
    module_file : str
        Module's filename, e.g. run_scraper.py
    cwd : str
        Module's current working directory, e.g. .../lyrics-scraper/script

    Returns
    -------
    logger_name : str
        Logger's name, e.g. script.run_scraper

    Notes
    -----
    If the module is read from script, then `module_name` will be equal to
    ``'__main__'`` [1]. In that case, the module's working directory and its
    filename will be used to build the logger's name.

    The reason for differentiating the console and file loggers in the way
    their names end (.c for console loggers and .f for file loggers) is to
    be able to setup a new logger with the same logging options as an existing
    logger of the same type. For example, a new file logger will have the same
    logging options (level, class, filename, mode, formatter) as an existing
    file logger. See ``logging_boilerplate._add_loggers`` where we are adding
    new loggers and configuring them with the same logging options as existing
    loggers of the same corresponding type.

    A basic **console** logger is setup with debug logging level and whose

    Parameters
    ----------
    logger : logging.Logger, optional
        A console logger (the default value is ``None`` which implies that a
        console logger will be setup from scratch, i.e. without a logging

    Notes
    -----
    A logging.StreamHandler() (i.e. console handler) is added to the logger's
    handlers.

    A handler's log level filters out logs whose levels are inferior, e.g. a
    log handler with the INFO level will not handle DEBUG logs [1].

    get displayed).

    Also, a date and time can be added to the beginning of the log filename.

    Parameters
    ----------
    logging_config : str or dict
        The YAML configuration file path or the logging ``dict`` that is used
        to setup the logging.
    add_datetime : bool, optional
